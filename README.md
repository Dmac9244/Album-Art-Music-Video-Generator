# Album-Art-Music-Video-Generator
The objective here is to make music videos from a background image, the album art, the song (+metadata), and as a bonus, write a txt with much of the info, so it can be used as a description in a youtube video
This repository was also made as a call to help, because the code right now reminds me of spaghetti
#Requirements:
1. python3
2. a lot of pacience
